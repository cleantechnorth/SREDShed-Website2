Step 1: Review StackAdept.com

•	Extract key topics, themes, and recurring series (e.g., SR&ED program explanations, tax credit guides, grant/subsidy discussions)[1][2][3].
•	Identify the visual branding: logo, channel art, color palette, and any distinctive imagery or motifs used in the videos and thumbnails.
Step 3: Design the Replit-Based Website
•	Structure:
Replicate the main structure of StackAdept.com, including:
o	Homepage with featured content Maximum 3 YouTube videos from the below. Note that the code should update the videos every time a new video is added. Including the latest in the three: https://youtube.com/@sredfromtheshed2727?si=SdsfKZB3pqWzQ8NO
o	Content Page that features all https://youtube.com/@sredfromtheshed2727?si=SdsfKZB3pqWzQ8NO content. Note that the code should update the videos every time a new video is added. Including all videos from most recent to oldest. 
o	About – Content is below. 
•	There should be a subscribe button for Substack (<iframe src="https://sredshed.substack.com/embed" width="480" height="320" style="border:1px solid #EEE; background:white;" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>) in the top right of the home page navigation.
•	Content Page:
This page should have 2 sections. 
o	1) Populate the site with content from the "SRED From The Shed" channel:
	Embed YouTube videos and provide Summary or highlight key points from each video
o	2) Embed the substack button at: <iframe src="https://sredshed.substack.com/embed" width="480" height="320" style="border:1px solid #EEE; background:white;" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> 
o	
•	Contact Pages – The Contact Page will include the below Hubspot form:
<script charset="utf-8" type="text/javascript" src="//js.hsforms.net/forms/embed/v2.js"></script>
<script>
  hbspt.forms.create({
    portalId: "7193539",
    formId: "d98b1dd1-79b5-4d82-8d77-c0be78b2a6a1",
    region: "na1"
  });
</script>
o	
•	Branding:
Use the imagery, colors, and logo from "SRED From The Shed" to ensure the site feels like an extension of the channel[1].
o	Use the attached, updated logo in the top Left.
o	Adapt the color palette and visual style seen in the channel's branding and the attached logo
o	Incorporate the channel logo prominently
o	Use relevant icons or imagery which will also be uploaded. 
•	Technical:
o	Use Replit’s web development stack (HTML/CSS/JS or a framework of your choice)
o	Ensure the site is responsive and accessible, but can be hosted as a STATIC SITE
o	Include documentation for future content updates (e.g., how to add new videos/transcripts)
 
Deliverables
•	A working Replit project link to the website that can be deployed on a static site. 
•	A brief documentation file explaining:
o	Site structure and navigation
o	How to update/add new content
o	Any design choices made to align with "SRED From The Shed" branding
 
Additional Notes
•	If the SRED From The Shed logo or color palette is not directly available, use best judgment based on YouTube channel art and video thumbnails[1].
•	Prioritize clarity, ease of navigation, and a clean, modern look consistent with both StackAdept.com and the SRED From The Shed brand.
